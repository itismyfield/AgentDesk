## NoSeedAfterClear breaks
The shortest path has 10 steps:
0. Old session and a queued input
1. Commit the seed original (acceptance): Seed committed; gate holds it
2. Terminate takes transition and fence: Restart holds the transition and fence
3. Close only the captured pane: Exact close confirmed; retire and settle
4. Retire CAS and settle the old turn: Old execution retired; exclusion still held
5. Disconnect keeping selector, release, wake: Exclusion released; reply pending
6. Owner starts the front: register the launch: Owner turn began a launch
7. Install Pending over the vacant row: Owner turn installed Pending
8. Create the pane once: Create answered; first input not submitted
9. User clear begins: bump the clear epoch: Clear began: epoch bumped; a turn is launching
10. Submit the first input: The seed ran after a clear began
