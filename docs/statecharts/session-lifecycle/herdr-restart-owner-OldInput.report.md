## NoOldPaneInput breaks
The shortest path has 3 steps:
0. Old session and a queued input
1. Commit the seed original (acceptance): Seed committed; gate holds it
2. Terminate takes transition and fence: Restart holds the transition and fence
3. Stale permission types into the old pane: Old pane received an input while the restart was open
